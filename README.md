(1): Slow, uses symbolic execution.

(2): For the coarse-grained evaluation, we developed a variant of ArgusSaf that can reason on nested libraries

(3): For the coarse-grained evaluation, Ghidra was enhanced to deal with nested libraries

(4): It is possible to increase the calldepth, but there is a trade-off between running time/memory usage and desired calldepth.

n/a: not applicable, e.g., Ghidra is not involved in the resolution of JNI mapping.
